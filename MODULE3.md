## What is Module 3?


Module 3 is the last period of `TC2038B: Analysis of Advanced Algorithms` class in ITESM. Due to problems in the semester, we had several changes regarding the teachers as well as the topics covered in said class.

### Topics Covered
1. Floyd Algorithm 
2. Knapsack Problem (DP)
3. Max Flow (Floyd-Warshall Algorithm) 
4. Prim / Krusal Algorithms
5. Computational Geometry (Voronoi Diagram, Delaunay Triangulation)
6. Randomized Algorithms 

These subjects can be seen in the `study/module3` folder.
